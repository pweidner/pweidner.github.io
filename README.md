### Hi there!

I'm a scientist with a general interest in Molecular Biology, Genetics and Autoimmunity.
I joined the wonderful [Sanders Lab](https://sanders.science) at the Max-Delbr√ºck-Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC).
As a PhD student of the "Single cell approaches for personalized medicine" focus area of the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (BIMSB) I investigate how somatic mosaicism contributes to tissue homeostasis and human disease.

Happy research!
