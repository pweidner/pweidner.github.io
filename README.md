Hi there!


I'm a scientist with a general interest in Molecular Biology, Genetics and Autoimmunity. I recently joined the Sanders Lab at the Max-Delbr√ºck-Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) at the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (BIMSB).

As a PhD student in the "Single cell approaches for personalized medicine" focus group, I investigate how somatic mosaicism contributes to tissue homeostasis and human disease. Happy research!
